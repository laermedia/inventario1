# inventario1
This is a simple inventory written in PHP using classes. I have used the model MVC (Model–view–controller).
You can sign up and login, and once you are in, you will can create new items or delete them. You can also see your profile and update your user data.
It has error handling, password encryption, and protection against SQL injection.
App in Spanish.
